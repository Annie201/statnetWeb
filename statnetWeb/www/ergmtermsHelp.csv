absdiffcat,"(attrname, base=NULL)",binary,"Categorical absolute difference: Theattrname argument is a character string giving the name of a quantitative attribute in the network's vertex attribute list. This term adds one statistic for every possible nonzero distinct value ofabs(attrname[i]-attrname[j]) in the network; the value of each such statistic is the number of edges in the network with the corresponding absolute difference. The optional base argument is a vector indicating which nonzero differences, in order from smallest to largest, should be omitted from the model (i.e., treated like the zero-difference category). The baseargument, if used, should contain indices, not differences themselves. For instance, if the possible values ofabs(attrname[i]-attrname[j]) are 0, 0.5, 3, 3.5, and 10, then to omit 0.5 and 10 one should set base=c(1, 4).

altkstar,"(lambda, fixed=FALSE)",binary,"Alternating k-star: This term adds one network statistic to the model equal to a weighted alternating sequence of k-star statistics with weight parameter lambda. This is the version given in Snijders et al. (2006). The gwdegree and altkstarproduce mathematically equivalent models, as long as they are used together with theedges (or kstar(1)) term, yet the interpretation of the gwdegree parameters is slightly more straightforward than the interpretation of the altkstar parameters. For this reason, we recommend the use of the gwdegree instead of altkstar. See Section 3 and especially equation (13) of Hunter (2007) for details. The optional argument fixed indicates whether the scale parameter lambda is to be fit as a curved exponential family model (see Hunter and Handcock, 2006). The default isFALSE, which means the scale parameter is not fixed and thus the model is a CEF model. This term can only be used with undirected networks."

This term counts all k-stars in which the b2 nodes (called events in some contexts) are homophilous in the sense that they all share the same value of attrname. However, the b1 node (in some contexts, the actor) at the center of the k-star does NOT have to have the same value as the b2 nodes; indeed, the values taken by the b1 nodes may be completely distinct from those of the b2 nodes, which allows for the use of this term in cases where there are two separate nodal attributes, one for the b1 nodes and another for the b2 nodes (in this case, however, these two attributes should be combined to form a single nodal attribute called attrname. A different statistic is created for each value of attrname seen in a b1 node, even if no k-stars are observed with this value. Whether a different statistic is created for each value seen in a b2 node depends on the value of the diffargument: When diff=TRUE, the default, a different statistic is created for each value and thus the behavior of this term is reminiscent of the nodemix term, from which it takes its name; whendiff=FALSE, all homophilous k-stars are counted together, though these k-stars are still categorized according to the value of the central b1 node. The base term may be used to control which of the possible terms are left out of the model: By default, all terms are included, but if base is set to a vector of indices then the corresponding terms (in the order they would be created when base=NULL) are left out."

Assuming that there are n_1 values ofb1attrname among the b1 nodes and n_2values of b2attrname among the b2 nodes, then the total number of distinct categories of two stars according to these two attributes is n_1(n_2)(n_2+1)/2. This model term creates a distinct statistic counting each of these categories.

Each of these statistics gives the number of times a node with that attribute or those attributes appears as the node of origin of a directed tie. To include all attribute values is usually not a good idea – though this may be accomplished if desired by setting base=0– because the sum of all such statistics equals the number of edges and hence a linear dependency would arise in any model also including edges. Thus, the baseargument tells which value(s) (numbered in order according to the sort function) should be omitted. The default value,base=1, means that the smallest (i.e., first in sorted order) attribute value is omitted. For example, if the “fruit” factor has levels “orange”, “apple”, “banana”, and “pear”, then to add just two terms, one for “apple” and one for “pear”, then set “banana” and “orange” to the base (remember to sort the values first) by usingnodefactor(""fruit"", base=2:3).

threepath,(keep=1:4),binary,"Three-paths: For an undirected network, this term adds one statistic equal to the number of threepaths, where a threepath is defined as a path of length three that traverses three distinct edges. Note that a threepath need not include four distinct nodes; in particular, a triangle counts as three threepaths. For a directed network, this term adds four statistics (or some subset of these four specified by the keepargument), one for each of the four distinct types of directed three-paths. If the nodes of the path are written from left to right such that the middle edge points to the right (R), then the four types are RRR, RRL, LRR, and LRL. That is, an RRR threepath is of the form i-->j-->k-->l, and RRL threepath is of the form i-->j-->k<--l, etc. Like in the undirected case, there is no requirement that the nodes be distinct in a directed threepath. However, the three edges must all be distinct. Thus, a mutual tie i<-->jdoes not count as a threepath of the form i-->j-->i<--j; however, in the subnetwork i<-->j-->k, there are two directed threepaths, one LRR (k<--j-->i-->j) and one RRR (k<--j-->i-->j)."

triadcensus,(d),binary,"Triad census: For a directed network, this term adds one network statistic for each of an arbitrary subset of the 16 possible types of triads categorized by Davis and Leinhardt (1972) as 003, 012, 102, 021D, 021U, 021C, 111D, 111U, 030T, 030C, 201, 120D, 120U, 120C, 210, and 300. Note that at least one category should be dropped; otherwise a linear dependency will exist among the 16 statistics, since they must sum to the total number of three-node sets. By default, the category 003, which is the category of completely empty three-node sets, is dropped. This is considered category zero, and the others are numbered 1 through 15 in the order given above. By specifying a numeric vector of integers from 0 to 15 as the d argument, the user may specify a set of terms to add other than the default value of 1:15. Each statistic is the count of the corresponding triad type in the network. For details on the 16 types, see ?triad.classify in the {sna} package, on which this code is based. For an undirected network, the triad census is over the four types defined by the number of ties (i.e., 0, 1, 2, and 3), and the default is to add 1:3, which is to say that the 0 is dropped; however, this too may be controlled by changing the d argument to a numeric vector giving a subset of \{0, 1, 2, 3\}."

The former case is called a “transitive triple” and the latter is called a “cyclic triple”, so in the case of a directed network,triangle equals ttriple plus ctriple— thus at most two of these three terms can be in a model. The optional argumentattrname restricts the count to those triples of nodes with equal values of the vertex attribute specified by attrname."
tripercent,(attrname=NULL) ,binary,"Triangle percentage: This term adds one statistic to the model equal to 100 times the ratio of the number of triangles in the network to the sum of the number of triangles and the number of 2-stars not in triangles (the latter is considered a potential but incomplete triangle). In case the denominator equals zero, the statistic is defined to be zero. For the definition of triangle, see triangle. The optional argument attrname restricts the counts (both numerator and denominator) to those triples of nodes with equal values of the vertex attribute specified by attrname. This is often called the mean correlation coefficient. This term can only be used with undirected networks; for directed networks, it is difficult to define the numerator and denominator in a consistent and meaningful way."

For directed networks a 2-path is also a mixed 2-star but the interpretation is usually different; see m2star. For undirected networks a twopath is defined as a pair of edges \{i,j\}, \{j,k\}. That is, it is an undirected path of length 2 from i to k via j, also known as a 2-star."
